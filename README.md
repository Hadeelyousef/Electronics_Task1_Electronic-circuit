This repositpry contains an **electrical circuit** with 5 servo motors, which are programmed to move at an angle of **90 degrees**.

And it contains several files:

**Crcuit.brd file:** contains the **Xml** code for the electrical circuit.

**Code.ino file:** contains **C++** code.

The repository also includes a picture and a video to illustrate the work of the electrical circuit.

**About wires:**

**Orange:** (Signal) Each servo motor is connected to a different signal in the Arduino.

**Red:** (Power) It connects the Arduino to each servo motor via the **Blue** wire.

**Brown:** (Ground) It connects the Arduino to each servo motor via the **Gray** wire.
